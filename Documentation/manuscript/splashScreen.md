Let's start with a simple splash screen. We will only need to build some simple one way bindings. The screen will 
only need three properties and an optional fourth:

    1. Title
    2. Details about what is currently going on
    3. Progress Bar showing how many steps out of the total startup steps are completed
    4. Progress Bar showing the current progress of the current startup step (optional)
    
We will start even simpler though, we will have a 3 property splash screen that basically passes everything through
without any changes.
